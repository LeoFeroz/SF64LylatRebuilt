# Quick Start

Starship does not include any copyrighted assets.  You are required to provide a supported copy of the game.

### 1. Verify your ROM dump
The supported ROMs are US 1.0 and US 1.1 Rev A versions. You can verify you have dumped a supported copy of the game by using the SHA-1 File Checksum Online at https://www.romhacking.net/hash/. 

* The SHA-1 hash for a US 1.0 ROM is D8B1088520F7C5F81433292A9258C1184AFA1457.
* The SHA-1 hash for a US 1.1 ROM is 09F0D105F476B00EFA5303A3EBC42E60A7753B7A.

Starship also supports voice language replacement use from both EU (Lylat) and JP (Japanese) when used in conjunction with an US ROM.

Note: JP and EU versions of the game are not supported for the base asset O2R creation, a US ROM must be used for it, and you can only use one voice language replacement at a time (Either EU or JP).

### 2. Verify your ROM is in .z64 format
Your ROM needs to be in .z64 format. If it's in .n64 format, use the following to convert it to a .z64: https://hack64.net/tools/swapper.php

### 2. Download Starship from [Releases](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Starship/releases)

### 3. Generating the OTR from the ROM and Play!
#### Windows
* Extract every file from the zip into a folder of your choosing.
* Run starship.exe and select your US 1.0 or US 1.1 ROM.

# Custom Assets
Custom assets are packed in `.o2r` or `.otr` files. To use custom assets, place them in the `mods` folder.

If you're interested in creating and/or packing your own custom asset `.o2r`/`.otr` files, check out the following tools:
* [**retro - OTR and O2R generator**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro)
* [**fast64 - Blender plugin (Note that SF64 is not supported at this time)**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/fast64)
